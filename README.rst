TinyUSB is an open-source cross-platform USB Host/Device stack for
embedded system, designed to be memory-safe with no dynamic allocation
and thread-safe with all interrupt events are deferred then handled in
the non-ISR task function.

Please take a look at the online `documentation <https://docs.tinyusb.org/>`__.

Here is the list of `Supported Devices`_ that can be used with provided examples.

Device Stack
============

Supports multiple device configurations by dynamically changing USB descriptors, low power functions such like suspend, resume, and remote wakeup. The following device classes are supported:

-  Audio Class 2.0 (UAC2)
-  Bluetooth Host Controller Interface (BTH HCI)
-  Communication Device Class (CDC)
-  Device Firmware Update (DFU): DFU mode (WIP) and Runtinme
-  Human Interface Device (HID): Generic (In & Out), Keyboard, Mouse, Gamepad etc ...
-  Mass Storage Class (MSC): with multiple LUNs
-  Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)
-  Network with RNDIS, CDC-ECM (work in progress)
-  USB Test and Measurement Class (USBTMC)
-  Vendor-specific class support with generic In & Out endpoints. Can be used with MS OS 2.0 compatible descriptor to load winUSB driver without INF file.
-  `WebUSB <https://github.com/WICG/webusb>`__ with vendor-specific class

If you have a special requirement, `usbd_app_driver_get_cb()` can be used to write your own class driver without modifying the stack. Here is how the RPi team added their reset interface [raspberrypi/pico-sdk#197](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/pull/197)

Host Stack
==========

- Human Interface Device (HID): Keyboard, Mouse, Generic
- Mass Storage Class (MSC)
- Hub currently only supports 1 level of hub (due to my laziness)

OS Abstraction layer
====================

TinyUSB is completely thread-safe by pushing all Interrupt Service Request (ISR) events into a central queue, then processing them later in the non-ISR context task function. It also uses semaphore/mutex to access shared resources such as Communication Device Class (CDC) FIFO. Therefore the stack needs to use some of the OS's basic APIs. Following OSes are already supported out of the box.

- **No OS**
- **FreeRTOS**
- **Mynewt** Due to the newt package build system, Mynewt examples are better to be on its [own repo](https://github.com/hathach/mynewt-tinyusb-example)
