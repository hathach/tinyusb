Contributing
************

Contributing can be highly rewarding, but it can also be frustrating at times.
It takes time to review patches, and as this is an open source project, that
sometimes can take a while. The reviewing process depends on the availability
of the maintainers, who may not be always available. Please try to be
understanding throught the process.

There a few guidelines you need to keep in mind when contributing. Please have
a look at them as that will make the contribution process easier for all
parties.
