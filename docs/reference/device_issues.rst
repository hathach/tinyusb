Device specific known issues and workarounds
===============================================
This page lists known issues and workarounds for specific devices.

NXP LPC54600
----------------
**Severity: High**

**Not recommended for USB device applications (except high-speed host controller)**

Reference: `LPC54600 Errata Sheet`_

.. _LPC54600 Errata Sheet: https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/errata/ES_LPC546XX.pdf

The LPC54600 series have a very buggy USB controller, with 17 issues listed in the errata which is more than half of the total issues.

Most severe issues are:

- USB.2: In USB high-speed device mode, the NBytes field is not correct after BULK IN transfer
- USB.5: In USB full-speed host mode, linked list on done queue is broken.
- USB.15: USB high-speed device in endpoint TX data corruption

WCH CH32F20x/CH32V20x/CH32V30x
---------------------------------
**Severity: Medium**

**Not recommended for USB audio applications**

Reference: `CH32V30X Reference Manual`_ USBFS/USBHS controller chapter

.. _CH32V30X Reference Manual: https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH32FV2x_V3xRM_PDF.html

Data corruption may occur on isochronous endpoints. Due to the lacking of FIFO for interrupt status registers, later completed transfer will overwrite `INT_ST` and `RX_LEN` register if previous transfer processing is not completed.

Other types of transfers are not affected.
